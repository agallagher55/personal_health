"""Read/write helpers for the local JSON health-data store
(backend/data/health_data.json - see docs/backend-architecture.md).

Stores the raw data points returned by the Google Health API, grouped by
our metric name, plus a last-synced date per metric. Storing the raw
points (rather than remapping into a custom shape) avoids losing or
misrepresenting fields we haven't fully verified the schema of - see the
caveats in google_health_client.py. Any friendlier shaping for the
frontend (docs/api-contract.md) happens in server.py at serve time, not
here.
